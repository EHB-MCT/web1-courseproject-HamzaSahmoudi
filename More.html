				<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
				<img src="Images/Aboutme.jpeg" />
				<p>
					I'm a student at Erasmushogeschool Brussel. I'm studying Multimedia & Creatieve Technologie. I chose this direction because I'm a creative person and I like everything that is techonology, both are in the same direction so it was perfect
					for me. A project I want to do and create my own games. For that you have to work hard and very hard. I have 1 little brother and 2 older sisters. I'm Belgian of Moroccan origin. I like to do my hobbies in my spare time. I love traveling
					and discovering new things.
