								I love to cook, not only for myself, but also for others. My sister is always teaching me new recipes, which results not only in delicious dishes, but also in enjoyable moments. I really enjoy cooking dishes that I like to eat. At
								least later I'll know what to cook if I'm living on my own.

								May I introduce my cat Tarzan, who has been a faithful friend for the past three years. He quickly became my source of support, always by my side when I was facing difficulties. Tarzan loves to play and loves to crash on my bed at

								Who doesn't like to eat? I do. That's why I love to cook. I love discovering foods from every culture, but my favorite is Japanese food. Their rice, chicken, sauce, sushi, salad, noodles, soup. There are also Moroccan desserts that

								Exploring new places excites me. Whenever I visit somewhere new, I remember the routes and spots like I have a built-in GPS in my head. It's not just about going places; it's about creating a mental map that brings each adventure to
								life. Discovering fresh locations keeps my curiosity alive and pushes me to seek out new adventures.
